The project *Waterradiance* is an extension to the BEAM toolbox (http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam/).
It provides a GPF operator that is used to retrieve water-leaving reflectances and water properties
using a forward-model neural network whose output is optimised using the Levenberg-Marquardt method.
